\abstract{Breast cancer is a frequently diagnosed and in many cases fatal disease, especially in females. The danger associated with breast cancer asks for further techniques to improve the prognosis of patients suffering from breast cancer. 
Mammography is a widely used technique for screening breast cancer. In the present report, mammographic screens from the CBIS-DDSM Breast Cancer Image Datataset are used to perform binary breast cancer classification into malignant and benign. Classification is performed based on a machine learning approach using two different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): VGG16 and ResNet50.Best performance is achieved with the ...  }
