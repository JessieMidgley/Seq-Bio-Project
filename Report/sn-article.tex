\abstract{Breast cancer is a frequently diagnosed and in many cases fatal disease, especially in females. The danger associated with breast cancer asks for further techniques to improve the prognosis of patients suffering from breast cancer. 
Mammography is a widely used technique for screening breast cancer. In the present report, mammographic screens from the CBIS-DDSM Breast Cancer Image Datataset are used to perform binary breast cancer classification into malignant and benign. Classification is performed based on a machine learning approach using two different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): VGG16 and ResNet50.Best performance is achieved with the ...  }

\subsubsection{Learning Rate}\label{learningrate}
The learning rate is a hyperparameter of the optimizer, adopted to achieve better performance of machine learning models.
Yuanyuan et al. even claim that the learning rate is the hyperparameter with the largest influence on the classification accuracy of a model \cite{Yuanyuan_2020}.
The learning rate defines the weight with which we are updating the parameter at each iteration and it gives an inside on how fast the model adapts \cite{Brownlee_2020}.  
Finding an optimal value for this parameter is challenging. In the result section, results for different values of the learning rate are presented. 
Performance comparisons underline the importance of the parameter as the performance varies between different learning rates. 
If it is too large, the model's performance might not be optimal because it might miss the optimal value \cite{Brownlee_2020}.
If the learning rate is too small the training process might be time-consuming.
